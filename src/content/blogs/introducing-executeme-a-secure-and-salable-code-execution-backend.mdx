# Unleash Your Code: Introducing `executeme` - A Secure & Scalable Code Execution Backend

## Ever needed to run arbitrary code securely and efficiently?

Whether you're building an online judge, a coding playground, an educational platform, or even an automated testing service, executing user-submitted code in a safe and isolated environment is a fundamental challenge. That's where **`executeme`** comes in.

`executeme` is a robust and secure backend service designed precisely for this purpose. It allows you to run code snippets in various programming languages within isolated Docker containers, providing both security and scalability.

## ‚ú® What is `executeme`?

At its core, `executeme` is a Node.js-powered API that acts as an intermediary between your application and various language runtimes. When a user submits code, `executeme` takes care of spinning up a dedicated, isolated Docker container for that specific execution, runs the code, captures its output (or errors), and then cleans up the environment.

Here are some of its standout features:

* **Multi-Language Support:** Out-of-the-box, `executeme` supports Python, Node.js, and Java. Its modular design makes it straightforward to extend support to even more languages based on your needs.

* **Secure Docker Isolation:** Security is paramount. Every code execution happens within its own ephemeral Docker container. This ensures that user code cannot interfere with other executions or the host system, providing a secure sandbox.

* **Resource Limiting:** To prevent malicious code from consuming excessive resources (e.g., infinite loops, memory bombs), `executeme` applies configurable memory and CPU limits to each execution. This safeguards your infrastructure.

* **API-Driven:** Designed with integration in mind, `executeme` exposes a simple RESTful API endpoint. This makes it easy to hook it into your frontend applications or any other service requiring code execution capabilities.

* **Automated Cleanup:** No lingering artifacts! `executeme` automatically manages temporary directories and files created for each execution, ensuring a clean and efficient system.

## üí° Why Choose `executeme`?

`executeme` simplifies a complex problem. Instead of wrestling with container orchestration, security hardening, and managing multiple language runtimes yourself, you can integrate this ready-to-use backend. It‚Äôs perfect for:

* **Online Compilers/Editors:** Give your users a place to write and test code live.

* **Coding Challenge Platforms:** Automate the execution and evaluation of user solutions.

* **Educational Tools:** Provide interactive coding exercises and immediate feedback.

* **DevTools:** Quickly test snippets or automate code-dependent workflows.

## üöÄ Getting Started with `executeme`

Setting up `executeme` is designed to be quick and easy thanks to Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* **Docker** (Engine & Compose) installed.

* **Node.js** (LTS version, e.g., 20.x+) and **npm**.

### Installation & Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the `executeme` GitHub repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devlopersabbir/executeme.git](https://github.com/devlopersabbir/executeme.git)
    cd executeme
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `app` directory where the Node.js server is located and install its dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd app
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Build Docker Images:**
    This is a crucial step! `executeme` relies on pre-built Docker images for each language runtime. Build them using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```
    This command will build the following images:
    * `executor-nodejs:latest`
    * `executor-python:latest`
    * `executor-java:latest`
    * `executeme-nodejs-server:latest` (your main backend service)

4.  **Run the Services:**
    Once all images are built, you can launch the `executeme` backend service using Docker Compose. This will bring up your Node.js server and prepare the environment for code execution.
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
    Your Node.js server should now be running and accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the API

The primary way to interact with `executeme` is through its `/run` POST endpoint. You send your code and the desired language, and it returns the execution output.

### `POST /run`

**Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/run`
**Method:** `POST`
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

**Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "code": "print('Hello, World!')",
  "language": "python"
}
```
### Success Response (Status: `200 OK`):
```json
{
  "output": "Hello, World!\n"
}
```
### Error Response (Status: `400 Bad Request` or `500 Internal Server Error`):
```json
{
  "error": "Runtime error",
  "details": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"main.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    print(\"Hello, World\""
}
```
### `curl` Examples

Here's how you can test it directly from your terminal:

**Python Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "language": "python",
  "code": "print(\"Hello from Python!\")\nimport sys\nprint(sys.version)"
}' \
http://localhost:3000/run
```
**Node.js Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "language": "nodejs",
  "code": "console.log(\"Hello from Node.js!\");\nconsole.log(process.version);"
}' \
http://localhost:3000/run
```
**Java Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "language": "java",
  "code": "public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello from Java executor!\"); } }"
}' \
http://localhost:3000/run
```
